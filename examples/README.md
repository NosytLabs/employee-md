## 🔧 Customization Tips

### 1. Start with Scope
Define what your agent should and shouldn't do:

```yaml
scope:
  in_scope:
    - "Specific tasks your agent handles"
  out_of_scope:
    - "Tasks that require human judgment"
```

### 2. Set Appropriate Guardrails
Always configure safety constraints:

```yaml
guardrails:
  prohibited_actions:
    - "anything-dangerous"
  confidence_threshold: 0.8
```

### 3. Configure Integrations
Add the tools your agent needs:

```yaml
integration:
  mcp_servers:
    - name: "your-tools"
      endpoint: "http://localhost:8080"
```
